I made this project beacuse some keys of my keyboard stopped working (LOL)

## How it works?
It creates a simple server on your computer that can receive api calls from a HTML interface with commands on how to move the mouse cursor or to print something on screen.

To make it properly run you'll need to run the index.html file on another server that you can access by your phone, then you'll have to install the python libraries: *Flask* and *pynput*.
After that, just execute the python script *Server.py* and access the interface on your phone.

## Features:
You can:
- Send a text from your smartphone to any text field on your computer.
- Control your mouse cursor by clicking the arrows on the interface.
- Move up, down, left and right as if you're pressing these keys by checking the *Toggle movement by keyboard* checkbox.
- Use the gray rectangle down in the bottom to act as a laptop simple trackpad, so whereever you click on the trackpad the mouse cursor will follow on your computer.
- Change the distance that the mouse cursor will move by changing the value on the slider *mouse range*.
- Mimic the left and right clicks of your mouse by clicking the respective buttons on the screen.
- Mimic the page-up and page-down keys of your keyboard by clicking the respective buttons on the screen.

## About this project
This is the very first version of this project so it is not complete. But you can use it and change it as you want.
